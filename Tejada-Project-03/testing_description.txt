Analysis:
1-----> The server accepted just a port number and used the default dictionary.
The server also printed out to stdout the thread number the client used and the
socket obtained. All words were concatenated correctly with 'OK'. The log file 
also logged all the concatenated strings.

2-----> The server accepted a dictionary and a port number. The server correctly
printed out the OK/MISSPELLED words. Each thread was only able to print a time
and multiple clients could not get multiple locks at once. The only error came up
when a client tried to print nothing, it took the last few characters f the previous
word sent to the server. The log worked correctly.
